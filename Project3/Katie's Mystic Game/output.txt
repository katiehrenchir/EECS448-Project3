Your husband needs to straight up tell your step daughter that he's disappointed with her, and he's not going to go along with the charade that she's the innocent victim and you are the evil step mother that forced her to get an abortion. Nor will he (and by extension you) be offering them any financial help. 

Do not apologize. You did nothing wrong. Your husband needs to have your back on this, even if it means he'll be missing her wedding/her. I very much doubt this is a marriage that's going to last, anyway. Your step daughter is clearly not mature enough for marriage, he seems controlling, and it's going to be built on lies.

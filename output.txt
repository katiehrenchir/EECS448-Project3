EDIT: I managed to find [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ycjp2/me_24f_with_my_friendflatmate_22f_caused_my/) I was talking about below, for those interested- it's heartbreaking. Her original update posts were too, but it looks like they've been removed. Don't let this be your family, OP.

A woman made a post here a few months back about how her best friend/roommate had always driven like your BIL does but had never been in an accident. Everyone in their friend group had always joked that one day she was going to get into an accident and kill someone, and they were right.

OP was pregnant, got into the car with her friend to make a quick trip, and the friend sped through a red light at an intersection, just like your BIL did. They got in a wreck, and OP lost her baby. The post wasn't just about how to handle her relationship with the friend (who was mortified and moved out) but how to deal with the fact that OP felt like she had let it happen. It had been an unnecessary trip, and OP felt that by choosing to get in the car with her friend, she had killed her own baby and that she was afraid she would never be able to forgive herself.

One day your BIL is going to get into a wreck if he keeps driving like that. You're right to step in and protect your kids, but I agree with the poster who said it's like honey vs vinegar.

If I was your wife, even if I logically knew that this was the right decision, I would probably feel like you were accusing me of not being able to make good decisions about my children's safety. She may not have realized how bad her brother's driving is until her children were involved, and might be struggling with the idea that she indirectly put their lives in danger.
